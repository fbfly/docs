# What is FBFly?

FbFly is building tools for Facebook Groups to take on a life of their own by giving them superpowers - from fundraising to voting on how funds owned by the group should be spent. We do this using DAOs which stand for [Decentralised Autonomous Organisations](about-daos/).   
  
The technology developed by FbFly enables a Facebook Group to build a DAO to support their operations within minutes.
