# Voting

### **How does the voting system work on Proposals?**

FBFly uses a voting mechanism called “Conviction Voting”. Unlike other voting mechanisms, with conviction vote, the support threshold required for a proposal to pass is dynamic. The threshold varies based on the amount of FBC tokens an entity is requesting. A small amount of FBC tokens requested requires a small number of FBC to be staked in support. By contrast, a request for a large amount of FBC tokens requires a large number of FBC to be staked by other members in support. This voting mechanism that is based on “just enough” support principles is intended to result in faster decision making and more efficient use of collective brain power.
