# Why do I need funds to create and manage a DAO?

Each data transaction costs money which is used to verify and store transactions. But don't worry, the costs are miniscule. You can complete 500 transactions for $.01. A transaction might include creating the DAO in the first place, requesting a new payment to be made or voting on an existing request for funds.
